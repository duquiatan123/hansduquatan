<h4>CHAPTER 3
HTML - TEXT & TEXT FORMATTING
HTML - TEXT
Text is the backbone of any web page. It plays an double role; it provides content for web surfers to enjoy as they skim through articles and articles of information, but it also gives Search Engines and Spiders keywords and meta data. It is because of text on web pages that we have a network of seemingly endless information available at our fingers.
HTML Paragraph Text
Any text containing more than a few lines (or sometimes even more) should exist inside of a paragraph tag. This tag is reserved specifically for blocks of text, such as those you would expect to find inside your favorite novel.</h4></section>

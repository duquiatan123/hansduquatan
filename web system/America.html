    <p><strong><font color="#75B459">NATIONAL MALL</font></strong></p>
    <p>
      mmaculately maintained by the National Park Service, the National Mall and Memorial Parks feature more than 1,000 acres of must-see monuments, sites and green space. 
While the Washington Monument towers above all else—quite literally, the city doesn’t zone for buildings taller than the marble icon—the Lincoln Memorial, Thomas Jefferson Memorial, Vietnam War Memorial and Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial are just as magnificent.
 Though it will take a full day (or two) to see the National Mall, set aside some time to peruse through some of Washington, D.C.’s top museums.

    <p><strong><font color="#75B459">OLD FAITHFUL</font></strong></p>
    <p>
      A cone geyser found in Yellowstone National Park, Old Faithful is not entirely as predictable as it once was (it won’t erupt precisely every 74 minutes, for example) yet remains as historically exciting.
 When erupting, the geothermal feature unleashes more than 3,700 gallons of piping hot water.
 When you’re done marveling at the spectacle, spend at least a full day exploring the rest of the park.

    <p><strong><font color="#75B459">THE GRAND CANYON</font></strong></p>
    <p>
      The Grand Canyon in Arizona is a natural formation distinguished by layered bands of red rock, 
revealing millions of years of geological history in cross-section. Vast in scale, the canyon 
averages 10 miles across and a mile deep along its 277-mile length. Much of the area is a national 
park, with Colorado River white-water rapids and sweeping vistas.

    <p><strong><font color="#75B459">GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE</font></strong></p>
    <p>
      There are many great spots to frame up this San Francisco icon. Coit Tower, Battery Godfrey, Marin Headland, and Baker Beach all serve up memorable photos, but our favorite is Fort Point. Not only has the fortress safeguarded the city for over 150 years, it is a prime spot to capture a striking profile of the Golden Gate Bridge. The intricate masonry of the Fort blends nicely with the deco-inspired architecture of the bridge. Bridge architect Joseph Strauss recognized the Fort’s importance, and created a unique arch over its top. Insider tip: access to the roof at Fort Point closes at 4:30 pm, so make sure to plan accordingly.

      But gardens are not all Golden Gate Park has to offer! Head to the de Young Fine Arts Museum for spectacular art and a gorgeous view from the observation tower.  Or spend the afternoon in the California Academy of Sciences — the self-proclaimed “only place on Earth with an aquarium, planetarium, rainforest, and natural history museum—all under one living roof.” Or stop by the Bison paddock to visit the small herd of American bison that call Golden Gate Park home.

    <p><strong><font color="#75B459">OLD SAN JUAN</font></strong></p>
    <p>
      This is a 465-year-old neighborhood originally conceived as a military stronghold. Its 
7-square-block area has evolved into a charming residential and commercial district. The streets 
here are paved with cobbles of adoquine, a blue stone cast from furnace slag; they were brought over 
a ballast on Spanish ships and time and moisture have lent them their characteristic color. The city
 includes more than 400 carefully restored 16th- and 17th-century Spanish colonial buildings. 
The Old San Juan attracts many tourists, who also enjoy the gambling casinos, fine beaches, and 
tropical climate.
